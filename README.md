# 🚦 End-to-End Road Accident Analysis Project
This repository contains the files and analysis for a comprehensive data analytics project focused on gaining crucial insights into Road Accidents and Casualties for the years 2021 and 2022. The primary goal is to visualize accident distribution and severity, calculate essential road safety metrics (KPIs), and identify high-risk factors to drive effective safety interventions using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau.
## 🌟 Project Goal
To analyze historical road accident data and create interactive dashboards that visualize key metrics like Total Casualties and Accident Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight). The analysis focuses on identifying high-risk segments based on Vehicle Type, Road Type, and Location (Urban/Rural) to deliver actionable recommendations to road safety stakeholders.
## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following metrics were calculated to assess overall road safety performance:
1. Total Accidents: The absolute number of accidents recorded in the dataset.
2. Total Casualties: The total number of people injured or killed in the accidents.
3. Accident Severity Distribution: The percentage breakdown of casualties by Fatal, Serious, and Slight injury levels.
4. Year-over-Year (YoY) Change in Casualties: The percentage increase or decrease in casualties from 2021 to 2022.
5. Maximum Casualty Factors: Identification of the specific factors (e.g., Road Type, Vehicle Type) associated with the highest volume of casualties.
## 📊 Charts and Visualizations
The dashboards were designed to provide both executive summaries and detailed analysis:
1. Total Casualties KPI: Single tile KPI showing the overall volume of casualties.
2. Accident Severity Doughnut Chart: Visualizing the proportion of Fatal, Serious, and Slight casualties for the current year.
3. Monthly Casualties Trend: Line chart comparing the casualty count per month between the Current Year (2022) and the Previous Year (2021).
4. Casualties by Vehicle Type: Bar chart highlighting the vehicle category involved in the highest number of casualties.
5. Casualties by Road Type: Chart analyzing the distribution of casualties across different road classifications (e.g., Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway).
6. Casualties by Location/Time: Visualizing casualty counts broken down by Area (Urban/Rural) and Day/Night conditions.
## 🛠️ Technology Stack
1. Data Source: CSV file, excel file 
2. Database: MS SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
3. Analysis/Manipulation: SQL (For data integrity and query development)
4. Visualization/Dashboard: Power BI, Tableau, and Excel (Used for creating multi-platform interactive dashboards)

## 💡 Conclusion and Key Insights
This project delivered actionable road safety intelligence through validated, multi-platform dashboards.
1. Critical Risk Segments: Analysis identified specific factors demanding urgent attention, such as the highest volume of casualties occurring on Single Carriageway roads and involving a specific Vehicle Type (as determined by the analysis).
2. Strategic Need: Findings demand targeted intervention, such as reviewing safety measures for the high-risk road and vehicle types, and focusing educational efforts on the identified high-casualty area (Urban/Rural).
3. Technical Reliability: The solution provided versatile and reliable reporting across Power BI and Tableau, ensuring all stakeholders can access consistent performance metrics to inform resource allocation.
